# Smart Lift Prototype

## Overview

This project presents a Smart Lift Prototype engineered to optimize energy efficiency by minimizing unnecessary floor movements. The elevator system is controlled using an Arduino microcontroller and infrared (IR) sensors, enhancing the operational efficiency of the lift.

## Features

- **Energy-efficient design:** The lift only moves when necessary, reducing power consumption.
- **IR sensors:** Detects floor positions to ensure accurate and efficient floor movements.
- **Button-controlled:** Allows users to select their desired floor both inside and outside the elevator.
- **Automatic door control:** Opens and closes the elevator door automatically.
- **Real-time person detection:** Checks for the presence of a person on the floor when an outside button is pressed.

## Components

- Arduino microcontroller
- Stepper motor
- Servo motor
- IR sensors
- Push buttons

## Efficiency and Energy Savings

### Intelligent Floor Movement

The Smart Lift Prototype is designed with an intelligent control system that ensures the lift only moves when necessary. This design minimizes idle movements and reduces the overall energy consumption of the elevator system. Traditional elevators often make unnecessary trips, wasting energy and time. Our smart lift uses sensors and button inputs to determine the optimal path and only moves to the desired floors when needed.

### Real-time Person Detection

A key feature of our prototype is its ability to detect the presence of a person on the floor when an outside button is pressed. If a person moves away from the floor after pressing the button, the lift will stop at the nearest floor without opening the door. This functionality not only saves energy but also reduces wear and tear on the elevator system, prolonging its lifespan.

### Automatic Door Control

The elevator doors are controlled automatically by a servo motor, ensuring precise and efficient operation. The doors open only when the lift has reached the target floor and close after a specified period, reducing unnecessary energy usage.

### From Scratch Design

This prototype is built entirely from scratch, showcasing the innovation and technical prowess involved in the design. Every component, from the control algorithms to the hardware integration, has been meticulously crafted to create a seamless and efficient system. The project demonstrates how modern technology and thoughtful design can lead to significant improvements in everyday systems like elevators.

## Advantages

1. **Energy Savings:** By reducing unnecessary movements, the lift consumes less power, contributing to overall energy savings.
2. **Time Efficiency:** The intelligent control system ensures that the lift moves quickly and efficiently to the desired floors, reducing wait times for users.
3. **Reduced Wear and Tear:** Fewer movements mean less mechanical strain on the elevator components, leading to a longer operational life.
4. **User-Friendly:** The system is easy to use, with clear button controls and automatic door operations, providing a smooth and convenient experience for users.
5. **Innovative Technology:** Utilizes modern sensors and microcontroller technology to create a state-of-the-art elevator system.
